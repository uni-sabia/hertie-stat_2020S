GRAD C6 2001 - Statistics II - Assignment 6
-------------

Due by 11:59 pm on Sunday, March 22.


## Submission of Assignments

This homework is due by the date and time specified above. You are encouraged to collaborate with others on the solutions, but have to write up and submit your own files, which you host on your personal repository. 

The final product for this assignment should be 

1. An Rmd document named `assignment-X.Rmd` (X to be replaced with assignment number) that contains all code and text for the tasks described above, as well as 
2. A knitted HTML version of that document named `assignment-X.html` (X to be replaced with assignment number). 

Please make use of the template Rmd file in your repository and DO NOT RENAME IT. 

The documents should be clearly and cleanly formated and present all of your results. Please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your text and code are properly formated. 


## Submission of Reviews

The final product for the two anonymous reviews you get assigned every week should be

1. An Rmd document named `assignment-X-reviewer-feedback.Rmd` (X to be replaced with assignment number) that contains the scores for each task as well as verbal feedback on the individual tasks.

Please make use of the template Rmd files in the aut folders in your repository and DO NOT RENAME THEM. 


## Submission of Review Ratings

At the end of the process, you as the recipient of two reviews have the chance to rate the feedback from the reviewers along two dimensions: accuracy and helpfulness. To do so, please make use of the rating form `assignment-X-author-rating.Rmd`(X to be replaced with assignment number) and score the reviews on scales.


## Guidelines for Scoring and Feedback

1. Try always to be constructive and professional in the assessment of you colleagues' work. There is no need to be rude. Be respectful and considerate of the writer's feelings.
2. Try not to overwhelm your peer with too much commentary.  
3. You do not have to make edits in the original Rmd/Html file. If you want to provide concrete feedback on the code by suggesting alternative solutions or by pointing out flaws in the original code, please make use of the feedback form, where you can paste in / write up such content.
4. Scoring rules: (a) You are allowed to give fractional points (0, .25, .5, .75, 1) for individual subtasks. (b) In the feedback form, you provide total scores for each task. (c) Typos or grammatical errors are not subject to grading. (d) When output is requested in the task (e.g., an average value or an estimate), this output has to be visible in the knitted HTML. Just prodiving the code that generates this output is not enough.
5. Reread your feedback before submission. Make sure all your comments make sense and are easy to follow.
6. The peer review will be anonymous in both directions. Authors will not see how reviewed them and vice versa. This means that you are not supposed to write your name or other identifying information on any of the forms. Please note that, of course, the process is not anonymous for the instructors, who will have the final say on the scores.


## Timeline and Deadlines

To make sure that the peer review process works smoothly, it is extremely important that you comply with the submission deadlines. They are as follows:

1. The new assignment will be published every Tuesday until 1pm.

2. Submit your solutions by committing the modified Rmd file as well as the knitted HTML file to GitHub until Sunday, 11:59pm. For each hour the assignment is turned in late, the grade will be reduced by 10% (e.g. submission two hours after the deadline would result in 20% grade deduction).

3. You will be assigned (anonymous) solutions from two of your peers for review every Monday until 1pm. At the same time, the solutions will be posted online as a guideline for the review. 

4. Submit your (anonymous) review feedback sheets until Wednesday, 11:59pm. 

5. Consult the feedback you received and submit the review rating sheets until Sunday, 11:59pm.


## Coding Style

In this class we will not be enforcing any particular coding style, however it is important that the code you produce is *readable* and *consistent* in its formating. There are several R style guides online, e.g. from [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) and from [Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html).
