## Feedback

#### 1. Place Question 1 text here. [max. 3 points]

Everything is correct. The commands are perfectly written. Great!

#### 2. Place Question 2 text here. [max. 4 points]

Everything is perfect except for the command for point c), because you asked R to tell you the name of the first and last friend, but the question asked you to provide the names of the second and last, not first and last. 

#### 3. Place Question 3 text here. [max. 5 points]
Points a) and b) are correct. You didn't insert the codes for the rest of the question, so you missed those points. Thus your score is 2.
